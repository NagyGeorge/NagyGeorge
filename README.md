# Hey there

I'm George – a hobby coder, railroad worker, and part-time Arma 3 milsim nerd.  
I tinker with **Windows & Arch Linux**, and love building little tools to make gaming and server management easier.  

---

### What I’m Into
- **Hobby coding:** Mostly Python, some scripting for **Arma 3** and **server tools**  
- **Favorite OS playgrounds:** Windows & Arch Linux  
- **Current project:** [Arma 3 Modpack Updater](https://github.com/NagyGeorge/arma3-modpack-updater) – making mod updates painless for my unit  

---

### Music & Hobbies
- Big fan of **classic corridos** and Latin music – think **Chayanne**, Ariel Camacho, and Los Tigres del Norte  
- **Spanish speaker**
- Offline, you’ll find me **working the rails** or **planning Arma 3 missions** with my unit  

---

### 🔗 Cool Links
- **My Arma 3 Unit:** [3rd Infantry Division Realism Unit](https://3rdinf.us)  
-  **Python Hobby Projects:** (check my pinned repos!)  
- **Reach me:** via GitHub or Discord (friends & unit members know where to find me)

---

### Fun Fact
I’ve probably spent more time debugging batch files for Arma servers than actually playing the game.

*Just a hobbyist having fun with code, trains, and virtual battlefields.*
